Hi there! I'm a passionate automation tester and data scientist, and I love using my skills to help teams build better software and make data-driven decisions.

As an automation tester, I have experience designing and implementing test automation frameworks, writing and executing test scripts, and working with continuous integration and delivery tools. I'm familiar with a variety of programming languages and testing frameworks, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and tools to improve my craft.

As a data scientist, I specialize in using statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret complex data sets. I have experience with data wrangling, feature engineering, model building and evaluation, and data visualization. I also have experience working with big data platforms such as Hadoop and Spark, and I'm familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases.

On GitHub, you'll find a mix of projects related to automation testing and data science. Some of my recent projects include:

A test automation framework for a web application, written in Python and using Selenium WebDriver and Pytest.
An analysis of customer feedback data using natural language processing techniques, performed in Python using NLTK and Scikit-learn.
A machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company, built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
Feel free to check out my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on a project.
